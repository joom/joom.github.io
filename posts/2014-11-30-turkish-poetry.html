  <p>I guess I’ll start with an unnecessary rationale.</p>
<p>I haven’t been able to write a piece of my own for some time. I used to be better at writing, but I guess I’m just not that creative when it comes to writing. After starting to live in an English speaking environment, I also noticed that I was much less expressive in my daily life. I was just not witty anymore. Culturally, I didn’t have much in common with the people around me, so I could hardly make any political or cultural joke references.</p>
<p>In the middle of my second year in the US, I can say I have made a lot of progress about this problem. But when I couldn’t say this, I needed a way to convey who I am, and I have always loved Turkish music and poetry, so why not try one of those? Singing is also fun, but after meeting amazingly talented people, I don’t think I should try that. Translation, on the other hand, is something I think I do okay.</p>
<p>Of course, poetry translation has a lot of issues. One has to work on how to keep the poet’s tone, rhythm and structure. One can try to recreate the rhythm in the target language, but I usually feel like I have to give up too much meaning when I do that. I prefer to preserve the word choices of the poet, even though they can become very tricky sometimes. Also, sometimes the sentence just grammatically doesn’t make sense. Even in that case, I translated it into a grammatically correct English sentence. This is a loss of meaning and I can certainly work more on trying to keep the intended ambiguity in the target language. I’m an amateur, after all. So, I know that translated poems lose some meaning, there’s not much I can do about that, other than trying to keep as much meaning as possible. If the objective is to reflect the poet’s tone, there’s no way for me to succeed.</p>
